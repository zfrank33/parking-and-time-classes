# parking_project-parking garage and timer classes. I worked on creating a timer that counts down to 0 and that let to customer know whow much time they had left before being charged an extra $5 in ten min increments. The timer can be called w submit() and once time runs out it informs the customer they have been charged an extra $5. I originaly wanted to import the function and then call the function using an if loop. At first I could not get the import right but when i finally did it would cut the parking garage function off and not let it run full cycle so for now it has to be called manually.
